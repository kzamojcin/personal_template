Birth of my journal.

At the moment I'm trying to figure out how all of this will look like, although it is quite late and I'm really tired.

In couple of minutes I'm going to stop for today, and continue on this tomorrow.

Added notes folder, still there is no general idea in my mind how it all will look like.

It is safe to say that time will show.

I'm off for now, as I need to prepare and mail some documents.

**Abort.**  :clock1230: **12:30pm.**

Can't prepare documents at the moment, need to postpone it a bit.

I'm quite happy how this day worked out.

I've managed to close many day-to-day subjects that were open for past couple of weeks, still I would love to do some more work related stuff.
