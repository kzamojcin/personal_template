Birth of my journal.

At the moment I'm trying to figure out how all of this will look like, although it is quite late and I'm really tired.

In couple of minutes I'm going to stop for today, and continue on this tomorrow.

Added notes folder, still there is no general idea in my mind how it all will look like.

It is safe to say that time will show.

I'm off for now, as I need to prepare and mail some documents.

**Abort.**  :clock1230: **12:30pm.**

Can't prepare documents at the moment, need to postpone it a bit.

I'm quite happy how this day worked out.

I've managed to close many day-to-day subjects that were open for past couple of weeks, still I would love to do some more work related stuff.

**:clock930: 09:30pm**

Going to call it for today.
I'm off to do some drawing and afterwards off to bed. 

Over-&-Out.

Back in bussiness, for an hour already, this is good.

**:clock10: 10:10pm Bed time**

It was another fine day, I have managed to push project a bit forward and done some drawing ( although way way to little )

With couple of days away, I've refreshed my brain a bit and we are back on tracks to continue creation of our web template.

After 2 weeks of vacation it's time to get back to work :) 

#### 2017-08-17 :clock930: 09:26pm

A week of holidays again, WHO KNEW that was coming? ( seriously I did not )

Still I have managed to do some work, that was more graphic design related.

There is so much going on, and I'm happy about it, although I'm finding myself in lack of time.
I need to work harder on my organization skills.

Over-&-Out

Good morning, you.

I'm up and running.
Nothing super fancy for upcoming days, need to complete three projects.
Wish me luck.
