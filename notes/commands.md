## I'm putting together a list of commands that I use. The list is divided by native environments for those commands. 

### It's worth noting, that I'm working on MS Windows 7 OS, so some commands may vary if you use different operating system ( OS ).
### This list is personalized to my own likings and is not showing all of the commands available for each interface. 


#### Git Bash Command Line:

``` 
pwd - (prints path of the working directory)
cd "path" - (changes directory)
cd ".." - (goes up one directory)
cd "-" - (switches back to the directory you were previously in)
mkdir "directoryName" - (creates a new directory/folder)
touch "filename.filetype" - (creates new file)
echo - (puts data into a file if there is no such file, creates the file)
echo > - (">" replaces all content of the file, with new data)
echo >> - (">>" adds to the current content of the file)

```
