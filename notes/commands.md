## I'm putting together a list of commands that I use. The list is divided by native environments for those commands. 

### It's worth noting, that I'm working on MS Windows 7 OS, so some commands may vary if you use different operating system.
### This list is personalized to my own likings and is not showing all of the commands available for each interface. 




#### Git Bash Command Line:

``` 
git config --list (lists some major settings, like user name,email etc.)
git status (checks and shows if anything was modified)
git add	(prepares modified file to be commited)
git commit -m "insert comment here" (commits file changes with a comment )
git pull (pulls repository version from your github page)
git push (pushes changes to github)
git push origin :old_branch new_branch (This will both delete the old branch and push the new one)
pwd (prints path of the working directory)
git merge ()
cd path (changes directory)
cd .. (goes up one directory)
cd - (switches back to the directory you were previously in)
mkdir directoryName (creates a new directory/folder)
