### no.1 creation of "ingredient" list for our website

npm init (creates a **package.json** file, it keeps track of all of the packages that the project uses.)

npm install <pkg> --save (afterwards to install a package and
save it as a dependency in the package.json file.)

1. npm init
2. npm install package --save

npm install (alone it will go through our package.json file and it will install all packages listed there - How cool is this ?!)

To find a package go to npmjs.com or simply type in google what you want to achieve and back it with "npm"

.gitignore file helps us with ignoring files that are not going to be used by final ver of the website
